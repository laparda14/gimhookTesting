# Gimhook API

All APIs mentioned below are in the global scope.

If you need to use React, it's included in the global scope - You can just use the `React` variable anywhere.

**NOTE**: The Gimhook SDK currently isn't able to replace React imports in mods with a wrapper for the global variable. Please don't import it.
