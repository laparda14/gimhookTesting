# How to install Gimhook

## Using a pre-built version (Recommended)

Download a build from [here](https://github.com/gimhook/gimhook/releases) and run it.

It's as simple as that.

## Building Gimhook from source

**NOTE: You should probably just download a release and run it. It's a lot easier.**

1. Install Node.JS if you don't already have it
2. Download this repository with `git clone` and enter it (**DO NOT** download a zip file for this repository from github - it won't work)
3. Run `./scripts/build.sh` to build the desktop app
4. Run `./scripts/run.sh` to run the desktop app
5. Profit.
